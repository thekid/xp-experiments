Gnome API redesign
========================================================================
The XP Framework's GUI apis date back to the PHP4 / GTK1 days and have 
not been touched since then. In desparate need of an overhaul, and 
following the PHP-GTK2 releases and the stability provided by its PHP5 
backing, I began an experiment to redesign the API from scratch.

Prerequisites
-------------
The GUI api is based on the so-called "Gimp Tool Kit", better known as 
"Gtk" these days. Language bindings exist for many languages, PHP's is
called PHP-GTK.

Resources can be found at http://gtk.php.net/ and http://php-gtk.eu/

Setting it up (Windows)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Getting PHP-GTK is as easy as:

* Go to http://gtk.php.net/download.php
* Download php-gtk-2.0.1 Windows binary pack and php-gtk-2.0.1 Windows binary extensions pack
* Unpack their contents into, say, f:\Programme\php-gtk2
* You need php-gtk.extensions = php_gtk_libglade2.dll in php-cli.ini

Setting it up (Un*x)

Testing it
----------
To run the sample applications in this directory, use the following
shell commands:
<pre>
  $ XP_RT=/path/to/php-gtk2/php xp ButtonClick
  $ XP_RT=/path/to/php-gtk2/php xp GladeApp
