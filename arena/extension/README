Extension methods
========================================================================
This experiment evaluates the possibility to add extension methods to 
the XP Framework's core.

Motivation
----------
The following calls a method called "sorted" on an instance of the
lang.types.ArrayList class. The ArrayList class doesn't have such a
method, and we'll thus get a nice "call to undefined method" error
shortly before our program is terminated.

<code>
  $array= new ArrayList(3, 1, 2);
  $sorted= $array->sorted();
</code>

We could add this method to the class, but the next request would be to 
have <tt>filter(), map(), join(), collect(), partition()</tt>, and
whatever else methods in this class, which would turn it into the 
"swiss army knife" anti-pattern. Of course adding functionality can 
also be accomplished by subclassing or by creating an adapter which 
delegates all calls to the ArrayList class but the ones it wants to
implement on top. 

The subclass
~~~~~~~~~~~~
<code>
  class SortableArrayList extends ArrayList {
    public static function from(ArrayList $in) {
      $s= new self();
      $s->values= $in->values;
      $s->size= $in->size;
      return $s;
    }
    public function sorted() { ... }
  }
  
  $array= new ArrayList(3, 1, 2);
  $sorted= SortableArrayList::from($array)->sorted(); 
</code>

The delegate
~~~~~~~~~~~~  
<code>
  class SortableArrayList extends Object {
    public function __construct(ArrayList $delegate) {
      $this->delegate= $delegate;
    }
    public function __call($name, $args) {
      return call_user_func_array(array($this->delegate, $name), $args);
    }
    public function sorted() { ... } 
  }
  
  $array= new ArrayList(3, 1, 2);
  $sorted= create(new SortableArrayList($array))->sorted();  
</code>

Following the "one class, one responsibility" we could also refactor
the code out into an ArrayHelper class with all kinds of static helper 
functions or into an ArraySorter, an ArrayFilterer, and so on. We
wouldn't really be adding functionality in these cases, but let's have
a look at them nevertheless:

The helper class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<code>
  class Arrays extends Object {
    public static function sort(ArrayList $in) { ... } 
  }
  
  $array= new ArrayList(3, 1, 2);
  $sorted= Arrays::sort($array);
</code>

The sorter
~~~~~~~~~~
<code>
  class ArraySorter extends Object {
    public function sort(ArrayList $in) { ... } 
  }
  
  $array= new ArrayList(3, 1, 2);
  $sorted= create(new ArraySorter())->sort($array);
</code>

In any of these situations though, we have to write more sourcecode. 
More sourcecode not only for the extension itself but also when using it. 

Fact
----
Programmers can be safely said to be of the type of person who are lazy 
(or else we'd be shifting the bytes ourselves and not letting a 
programming language do the job, right?). Writing less code to solve a 
problem is not only fundamental to a programmer's motivation: It also
circumvents possible bugs.

<summary>
In this spirit, we'd like to accomplish the following:

* add functionality to an existing type without modifying it,
* import this functionality on demand to prevent bloat,
* write shortest amount of code when using the extension.
</summary>

Anatomy
-------
Extension methods let you "add" methods to existing types without having
to change the respective type itself. They are declared in a regular 
class as static methods, albeit being called as if they were instance 
methods on objects of the type they extend. Seen from the outside, using 
extension methods does not differ from calling methods actually defined 
inside that type.

Declaration
~~~~~~~~~~~
Given this, to implement an extension method "sorted" for the ArrayList
class so that it can be used as in the example from the beginning, we 
declare the following:

<code>
  class ArraySortingExtension extends Object {
  
    static function __static() {
      xp::extensions('lang.types.ArrayList', __CLASS__);
    }
    
    public static function sorted(ArrayList $self) {
      // Implementation here
    }
  }
</code>

There are two essential parts in this declaration: First of all, the
static initializer, which registers this class as a provider for extension
methods for the lang.types.ArrayList class. Second, the extension method
itself, which is declared <tt>public static</tt> and receives the ArrayList
instance to work on as its first parameter.

Using it
~~~~~~~~
Although extension methods are defined static, they are called using 
instance method syntax. However, extension methods are only available
if they're explicitly imported! This can be done by adding the extension
method class to the <tt>uses()</tt> list:

<code>
  uses('com.example.extensions.ArraySortingExtension');
</code>

Once this is achieved our example will work and the <tt>sorted()</tt>
call will yield an ArrayList containing the sorted values <tt>1, 2, 3</tt>.

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because of the way they're implemented, extension methods can only operate
on a type's public API. Extension methods are really only syntactic sugar,
backed by static method calls to an extension class. Thus, the following
two calls are equivalent from a protection level point of view.

<code>
  $sorted= $array->sorted();
  $sorted= ArraySortingExtension::sorted($array);
</code>

If you look at the second it becomes clear why only public methods can 
be called!

Furthermore, extension methods can only add functionality. Extension 
methods cannot overwrite existing methods. Thus, the following extension 
method will never be executed because the <tt>XPClass</tt> class already
has a <tt>getName()</tt> method:

<code>
  class XPClassExtensions extends Object {
    public static function getName(XPClass $self) { ... }
  }
</code>

The same applies for the methods defined in <tt>lang.Object</tt> itself,
every other object inherits these: <tt>hashCode()</tt>, <tt>equals()</tt>,
<tt>getClassName()</tt>, <tt>getClass()</tt> and <tt>toString()</tt>.


How it works
------------
Because almost everything happens at runtime in PHP, so do method call
lookups. When the PHP runtime encounters a method call, it looks at the
object and the method name, trying to find a method called equivalent
in the object's type declaration. If it fails to find a method by the
given name, PHP falls back to calling a special method by name 
[http://de3.php.net/__call __call] (a so-called "magic" method).

We make use of this facility in the <tt>Object</tt> base class and then
check <tt>xp::$registry</tt> for a matching extension class providing 
methods to <tt>$this</tt>' class. If found, the method is invoked, an
error is raised otherwise.

<code>
  public function __call($name, $args) {
    if (isset(xp::$registry[$m= get_class($this).'::'.$name])) {
      return xp::$registry[$m]->invokeArgs(NULL, array_merge(array($this), $args));
    }
    throw new Error('Call to undefined method '.$m);
  }
</code>

This poses a considerable performance impact on extension methods (the 
factor is about 8), though its effects are not really noticeable inside 
a regular business application working with databases, web service calls 
and the local file system.

XP Language
~~~~~~~~~~~
In the XP language, this performance problem is solved by compile time 
resolution.
